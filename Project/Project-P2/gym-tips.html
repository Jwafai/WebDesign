                <h3>1-BE PROUD</h3>
                <div class="testimonial">
                <p>Before diving into the practical gym tips for beginners, remember that the most important exercise catalyst is confidence. Whether you're lifting 100 pounds or 1 pound, you should be proud of yourself for showing up at the gym at all! Don't be intimidated by others or scared to ask for help.</p>
                </div>
              
                <h3>2-WORK HARD</h3>
                <div class="testimonial">
                    <p>
                        Remember that everyone at the gym was once in your shoes. Those first few workouts, no matter how "easy" they are in terms of physical intensity, are often the most mentally challenging. Be proud, remain confident and trust that your gym skills and fitness savvy will increase over time.</p>
                </div>
              
                <h3>3-ASK HOW</h3>
                <div class="testimonial">
                    <p>If you're not sweating by the end of your workout, perhaps you aren't pushing yourself hard enough. Try to reach an "out of breath" state at least once during your workout by incorporating high-intensity movements like sprinting, jumping jacks, burpees or squat jumps.</p>
                </div>

                  <h3>4-EAT UP</h3>
                  <div class="testimonial">
                    <p>Working out won't yield results if your diet isn't in check, too. Replace unhealthy foods with healthy alternatives and try to cut back on sugar. A good place to start is following the USDA's recommendation of filling at least half of your plate with fruits and vegetables.</p>
                </div>
                
                  <h3>5-REST AND REPEAT</h3>
                  <div class="testimonial">
                    <p>

                        Even the most experienced athletes appreciate the importance of rest after a hard workout. Try to get eight hours of sleep every night, take at least one rest day a week and always walk into the gym ready to repeat another solid workout. Once you get into a routine, you'll graduate from your "beginner" status in no time. </p>
