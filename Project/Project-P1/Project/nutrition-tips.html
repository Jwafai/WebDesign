                    <h2>4-FOODS TO AVOID</h2>
                    <p> It’s not just what you should eat, but what you shouldn’t. Stay away from processed foods and sugary drinks.
                        If you’re going to drink, stick with water or unsweetened tea. Soda is loaded with sugar and calories that will make it harder for you to lose weight or body shape. When your body is dehydrated, it will hold onto water weight and you’ll feel bloated.   </p>

                    <h2>5-DRINKING WATER</h2>
                    <p> When you exercise, your body sweats as it tries to return to its optimal temperature. As sweat evaporates from your skin, it removes heat from the body, but you also lose body fluid.
                        You need to drink fluid during exercise to replace the fluids you lose when you sweat. That way, you’ll reduce the risk of heat stress, maintain normal body function, and maintain performance levels.Drink 3-5 Liters per day   </p>
